##Synthea helper

Scripts for orientation and processing of [Synthea synthetic patient data](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea)
Output files can be generated by cloning and running synthea repo or downloaded [directly](https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads)https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads)

Only csv files directly linked to patient electronic health records are processed (minus billing, hospital, supplier information, FHIR JSON, etc.,)

Processing covers removing unwanted fields and standardising headers, adding patient age-at-event, filtering to create sample patient cohorts by criteria and joining records into a single table for easier mapping
