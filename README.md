# Generate sample patient cohorts with Synthea

Scripts for orientation and processing of Synthea synthetic patient data  
Output files can be generated by cloning and running synthea [repo](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) or downloaded [directly](https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads)

Only CSV files directly linked to patient electronic health records are processed here (minus billing, hospital, supplier information, FHIR JSON, etc.,)

Processing covers reoval of unwanted fields and standardising headers, adding patient age-at-event, filtering to generate sample patient cohorts by criteria and joining records into a single table for easier mapping and modelling
